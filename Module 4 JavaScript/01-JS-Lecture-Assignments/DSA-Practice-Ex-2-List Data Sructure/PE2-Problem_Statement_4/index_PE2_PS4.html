            According to legend, the first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus was about to
            be captured along with a band of 40 compatriots by Roman soldiers during the Jewish-
            Roman War. The Jewish soldiers decided that they preferred suicide to being captured
            and devised a plan for their demise They were to form a circle and kill every third
            soldier until they were all dead. Josephus and one other decided they wanted no part of
            this and quickly calculated where they needed to place themselves so they would be the
            last survivors. Write a program that allows you to place n people in a circle and specify
            that every mth person will be killed. The program should determine the number of the
            last two people left in the circle. Use a circularly linked list to solve the problem.
